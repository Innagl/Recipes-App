 MEAL SEARCH FILTER:
   This is a simple meal search/filter app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search through a list of meals dynamically as they type in the input field.

FEATURES:
  Live Search: Filter meals by name in real time
  Instant results without reloading the page
  Minimal and clean interface

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
  HTML5
  CSS3
  JavaScript

HOW IT WORKS:
  The app listens to the user's input (keyup event).
  It filters all .item elements based on the entered text.
  If a meal’s name includes the typed text → it stays visible, otherwise → it’s hidden.


EXAMPLE USAGE:
  Start typing in the search input.
  Meals matching your search will be shown automatically.
  To reset the list → simply clear the input.
